## The overall training code for SoundStream and Encodec
We provide the overall training code for the state-of-the-art neural audio codes. Our code support multiple-machine multiple-GPU training (based on DDP). Furthermore, we prove that our reproduced model has better performance than Encodec in our out-of-domain test set.

### We will introduce some key point in training soundstream. Furthermore, we will provide the checkpoint we trained in our dataset, including 16k and 24k.
